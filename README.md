# ClusterSim

README placeholder

Notes / To do list:

1. Currently the transmission_risk_per_timestep parameter combines the risk across all partners; it doesn't allow an individual to transmit multiple times (to multiple different partners). Probably need to fix that.

2. Need to add in the homogeneous or heterogeneous risk flag
